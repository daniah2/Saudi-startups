# Data Science Project: Exploratory Data Analysis and Insight Generation

## Project Overview
This project involves selecting a topic, sourcing relevant data (scraping is optional for extra credit), and deriving insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA). The final deliverable will include a presentation highlighting:
- The idea and its motivation.
- Data collection process.
- Data cleaning steps.
- Insights drawn from the data.

The goal is to utilize storytelling and visualization techniques to effectively communicate findings. Additional credit is available for deploying a dashboard or report page.



## Deliverables

### 1. **Presentation**
- Storytelling format covering:
  - Project idea and its purpose.
  - Data collection process.
  - Data cleaning methods.
  - Key insights supported by visualizations.
- Optional: Showcase deployment (e.g., Streamlit, Power BI).

### 2. **Python Notebooks**
- **Data Collection** (if data is scraped):
  - Detailed code for scraping or acquiring data.
  - Explanation of the data source.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Code and documentation for handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
  - Transformation and feature engineering steps.
- **Insights**:
  - Markdown cells describing insights derived from the data.
  - Visualizations (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn) generated using Python.

### 3. **Deployment (Optional, Extra Credit)**
- Create an interactive dashboard or report page.
- Use tools such as Streamlit, Power BI, or other platforms.
- Make the deployment available online (extra credit).
